## Bonus exercise: Enabling Internet access to the web applications.

As we are all security conscious, we have secured the HR web application to the best of our ability. Another requirement has surfaced, employees and 3rd parties needs to be able to access the web application from home without VPN.

Requirements:

1. Make the web application accessible from the public internet.

1. Speedy. Route the user to the closest region.

There are multiple ways to achieve this. You pick the one that your prefer. Discuss with your peers. What are the pros and cons of each approach?
