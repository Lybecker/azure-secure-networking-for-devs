# Virtual networks

Let's start simple. Your mission, should you accept it, is to create three virtual networks. Each should span 1024 IP addresses, first starting from IP `10.0.0.0`. Have the address spaces of all the virtual networks be next to each other (no empty space between).

The recommended order and names below:

1. `vnet-{team name}-dev-northeurope` in North Europe (starting from 10.0.0.0)
1. `vnet-{team name}-dev-westeurope` in West Europe
1. `vnet-{team name}-dev-eastus` in East US
