Our virtual networks are like galaxies. Systems of cells interlinked within cells interlinked. *Cells interlinked*. Drifting away in the empty vastness of silent space. In solitude, forever to travel alone until the last dark star shines its last light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.
